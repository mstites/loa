      <h1>Project Background & Context</h1>
    </div>
    <h1>Sex Toy Project History</h1>
    <p>Last semester, I started designing sex toys specifically for trans feminine people with penises. I consulted a number of other transfeminine people who are heavily integrated into the trans community and sketched many many designs. Since I was taking a full course load, I was unable to devote the time to this project I was so passionate about!</p>
    <p>I wanted to take a LOA so I have a chance to envelope myself in the design process and create meaningful progress in this mostly unexplored area in the adult market.</p>
    <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This project spawned as it was an intersection of a number of personal concerns, passions, and values:</p>
    <h3>1. My belief in the value of trans pleasure</h3>
    <p>My interest and belief in the importance of trans pleasure is a personal one. I am a transfeminine, nonbinary, dyke. Learning how to connect with my body and ground myself in my sexuality - and how that connects to my everyday life - has been an ongoing effort over the last few years. Learning how to navigate sex as a trans person with lots of bottom dysphoria has been difficult, but a very rewarding experience.</p>
    <p>I have talked to probably over a hundred other trans people about this topic, and have found that many have similar stories. I believe trans pleasure and sex is beautiful, but there is a lot of stigma around it that makes it difficult to have healthy sex as a trans person (eg dysphoria, societal expectations and pressures, transphobia - esp when dating).</p>
    <p>I want to use my engineering and design skills to support my trans community.</p>
    <h3>2. Market sh#t</h3>
    <p>There are very little sex toys and pleasure products developed with trans people in mind. This is particularly upsetting because I find that sex toys can play a big role in allevating dysphoria and affirming gender.</p>
    <p>For me, a good sex toy means a lot more than just getting off. It is something that is aesthetic, it is something that has the potential to make you feel connected and grounded at a deeper level.</p>
    <h3>3. My sex nerd brain</h3>
    <p>Ever since starting my personal journey with my connection to my body and sex, I have turned into a huge sex nerd. This includes sex toys, kink, trans and queer sex, sex education, and more! I just love talking about sex in a healthy and open way.</p>
    <h3>4. Career confusion</h3>
    <p>I often feel empty about the work I do and the impact it has on the world. This LOA is a chance to explore working on something that has the potential to make an impact.</p>
    <p>My hope is that one day I can make something that has a positive impact on the world. I love making things and I want to make something really positive and wonderful some day :). I really believe I can, and this at the very least is practice for that.</p>
    <h2>How Trans Designed Sex Toys Would have Helped Me</h2>
    <p>Part of wanting to work on this project is my desire for toys for myself. Many toys on the market work great on transfeminine people, and work on my body regardless of gender/genitalio (eg magic wand I love them). But in the same sense there are sex toys specifically built for vulvas, there should be sex toys built for trans feminine penile stimulation.</p>
    <p>Much of my solo, and even partnered sex, relies on the use of sex toys. Because of the availability of sex toys, I always use sex toys not designed for my anatomy in mind. This took a lot of patience to get results, which came with a lot of frustration and often disappointment. </p>
    <p>There are unique aspects of penile stimulation for trans feminine people on HRT that need to be addressed by sex toys made with that in mind.</p>

    <h1>Personal Journey with Sexuality</h1>
    <p>I have gone on a long journey with my personal sexuality in relation to my body. It has been probably the most difficult, but one of the most rewarding, experiences things I have ever done.</p>
    <h2>Difficulties and Narritives</h2>
    <p>Early on, I internalized a lot of narratives around being trans and having sex. Especially as a trans lesbian, the messaging was constant. From many cis women, especially cis lesbians, I was being told I was a predator, that I had sex in very specific ways (PIV) which made me very dysphoric - especially at the time, and that no one would ever desire me.</p>
    <p>Internal to my community, I was surrounded my other baby trans people. There was constant messaging that we wouldn’t have good sex or positive relationships with sex – and that was just the way it would be. This whole time period was a constant cycle of talking myself into a rut. </p>
    <h2>Getting Out</h2>
    <p>Even before starting hormones and getting more effective mental health care, I was able to make improve my self image and experience around sex. I met more experienced trans people who were able to guide me and remind me of my worth. As my self worth increased, I was able to cut out people who were not worth my time. Before focusing on my sexuality, I had to ground my core world.</p>
    <p>For my sexual life, I focused on affirming masturbation and solo exploration. I recalculated. Even though this made things less effective in terms of orgasm at first, it was beneficial long term to retrain my body and figured out what worked.</p>
    <h3>Partnered Sex</h3>
    <p>The last piece of this was having a really good, long term, partner which allowed me to once again explore receiving in sex and for the first time recieve in an affirming way. Unfortunately, it is the reality for many trans people, like myself, that many sexual relationships are not healthy, considerate, nor entirely consensual nor for the trans person involved. Good, patient, creative sex makes a world of difference.</p>
