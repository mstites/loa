      <h1>Project Background & Context</h1>
    </div>
    <h1>Sex Toy Project History</h1>
    <p>I have attempted to develope sex toys for trans people in the past. However, when I have had a full time course load, I have been unable to devote the time to do this important work properly and create meaningful results. Last semester, I created a number of sketches, interviewe a number of other transfeminine people who are heavily integrated into trans community spaces, and followed some designs.</p>
    <p>I wanted to take a LOA so I have a chance to envelope myself in the design process and create meaningful progress in this mostly unexplored area in the adult market.</p>
    <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This project spawned as it was an intersection of a number of personal concerns, passions, and values:</p>
    <h3>1. My belief in the value of trans pleasure</h3>
    <p>My interest and belief in the importance of trans pleasure is a personal one. I am a transfeminine, nonbinary, dyke. Learning how to connect with my body and ground myself in my sexuality - and how that connects to my everyday life - has been a huge ongoing effort for me over the last few years. Learning how to navigate sex in congruance and to affirm gender is a difficult, but very rewarding experience for many trans people (eg dysphoria, societal expectations and pressures, transphobia - esp when dating).</p>
    <p>I want to use my engineering and design skills, which I had many privileges that have allowed me to acquire, to support my trans community in this important piece of bodily connection.</p>
    <h3>2. Market sh#t</h3>
    <p>There are very little sex toys and pleasure products developed with trans people in mind. This is especially true for trans feminine people - where there are essentially none. I find this particuarly aggrivating given the particuarl value that I believe sexuality and pleasure can play in trans people's lives. Since many trans people deal with dysphoria around their genitalia, I think sex toys designed to allevate dysphoria could go a long way to provide affirmation, confidence, and pleasure.</p>
    <p>For me, a good sex toy means a lot more than just getting off. It is something that is aesthetic, it is something that has the potential to make you feel connected and grounded at a deeper level.</p>
    <h3>3. My sex nerd brain</h3>
    <p>Ever since starting my personal journey with my connection to my body and sex, I have been a bit (a lot) of a sex nerd. This includes sex toys, kink, trans and queer sex, sex education, and more! I just love talking about sex in a healthy and often academic-like way.</p>
    <h3>4. Career confusion</h3>
    <p>Over the last year, I have become increasingly confused as to what I want to do with my career. I know I love engineering and designing things. But I often feel empty about the work I do and the impact it has on the world and the communities I exist in. This LOA is a chance to explore working on something that I really feel has the pontial to make an impact.</p>
    <p>I know long term I will have to work a job that is under capitalism and just makes the money so I can live. But my hope is that one day I can make something that has a positive impact on the world. I love making things and I want to make something really positive and wonderful some day :). I really believe I can, and this at the very least is practice for that.</p>
    <h2>How Trans Designed Sex Toys Would have Helped Me</h2>
    <p>Part of wanting to work on this project is my desire for toys for myself. Many toys on the market work great on transfeminine people, and work on my body regardless of gender/genitalio (eg magic wand I love them). But in the same sense there are sex toys specifically built for vulvas, I think there should be sex toys built for trans femininine simulation.</p>
    <p>Much of my solo, and even partnered sex, relied on the use of sex toys. Because of the availability of sex toys, I was often using sex toys that were not designed for my anatomy in mind. They were not designed to be used in the way I was using them. I found ways to make them work and to be pleasurable.</p>
    <p>However, this took a lot of patience, time, and was very frustrating to get results - and often the results were disappointing. I was often buying things unsure of if they would ever work well on my body, with even more uncertainty than most people were buying sex toys.</p>
    <p>The reality is that there are unique aspects of penile stimulation for trans feminine people HRT compared to penile simulation compared to people on testosterone or clitoral simulation on cis women. The nerve density is different, the shape is different, etc. There are just some ways things could be optimized (as an engineer I really said optimize)!</p>
    <p>I totally don't regret my journey and time I spent. I still think many toys on the market work great on transfeminine people and on any body regardless of gender/genitalia (eg magic wand I love them). </p>

    <h1>Personal Journey with Sexuality</h1>
    <p>As referenced earlier, I have gone on a long journey with my personal sexuality in relation to my body. This has been ~ very ~ important for my sense of grounding and belonging in the world. I would say it has been one of the most pivotal parts of my trasness.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, I felt completely disconnected from my body. This was to the point where I felt completely consumed by my thoughts and distracted every day. All I could think about was my dysphoria. Every day was drudging pain. Today, my body and mine feel like one. Unpacking, gender journaling and reflecting, lots and lots of runs, and most of all HRT were all major components. But my constant consideration of my body in a sexual and physical context was the final piece. Even with HRT and the major part of my physical transition done, without that sexual connection I often still felt uneasy.</p>
    <h2>Difficulties and Narritives</h2>
    <p>Early on, I internalized a lot of narratives around being trans and having sex. I mean how could I not? Especially as a trans lesbian, the messaging was constant. From many cis women, especially cis lesbians, I was being told I was a predator, that I had sex in very specific ways (PIV) which made me very dysphoric - espcially at the time, that no one would ever desire me.</p>
    <p>Internal to my community, I was surrounded my other baby trans people who told me I would never have good sex or a positive relationship with sex. And I believed them. I mean, I couldn't even connect to my body outside of sex. How could I during such a vulnerable time? And who would even desire me or treat me nicely? It just seemed impossible. It became an endless circle of talking me self down. </p>
    <h2>Getting Out</h2>
    <p>Even before starting hormones and getting more effective mental health care, I was able to make progress. A big part of this was meeting more experienced trans people, especially trans feminine people, who could help guide me and reminded me I was worth ssomething. I started cutting out the people who were not worth my time. Before working on sexuality, I had to ground my outside world</p>
    <p>For my sexual life, I started focuisng on affirming masturbation. I recalculated and re-explored in a new way. Even though this made things less effective at first, it was beneficial long term to retrain my body and figured out what worked.</p>
    <h3>Partnered Sex</h3>
    <p>The last piece of this was having a really good, long term, partner which allowed me to once again explore recieving in sex and for the first time recieve in an affirming way. Unfortunately, it is the reality for many trans people, like myself, that many sexual relationships are not healthy, considerate, nor entierly consentual nor for the trans (particuarly trans feminine) person involved. Good, patient, explorative sex makes a world of difference</p>
