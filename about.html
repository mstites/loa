    <h1>Project Inspiration</h1>
    <p> This project was a long time in the making.</p>
    <h2>Why this project?</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>What am I doing? Why (for myself and others, passion project)? What will I learn (design, engineering, entrepreneurship, etc.)? What is the outcome (learning, products)? Why should you care? Why am I doing this instead a semester at school? What is my background?</p>
    <p>To learn more about the project and why it came about, see the about page.</p>
    <p>Why is this important?</p>
    <p>Could be an about page about the project, and an about page about me.</p>
    <h2>Existing Market</h2>
    <p> transfeminine and shopping for sex products</P>
      <h2>Sex while Trans</h2>
      <p>but sex can be a greate relief for trans people of any kind to reclaim their bodies and self, it can be beautiful</p>
      <h1>My Personal interest in the Subject</h1>
      <h2>My Transness & Sex Nerd Mind</h2>
      <h2>Sexuality</h2>
      <p>I have had a long battle with my personal relationships around my body, sex, and feeling grounded on the earth. The longer I have been going through the earth and learning more about the expansiveness of gender, bodies, and sex - the more connected I have become with my own body. A few years ago, I felt completely disconnected from my body, to the point where it consumed my thoughts and distracted e fromm my every day life - making every day a drudging pain to get through. Today, my body and mine feel one - and I believe thinking about our bodies in a sexual and physical context is an important part of that.</p>
      <p>I think there are a lot of narratives around being trans and having sex that I internalized early on. I always had the idea that I could never have good sex. I always thought I would eternally hate my body, both in sex and just navigating the world day to day. ANd in internalizing those thoughts, I turned what was already hard into something seemingly impossible to overcome. Through a fourtunate turn of events, I was given access to community and loving friends andpartners who helped me to give the space I needed to heal from the messenging and society which did not love or represent bodies like mine.</p>
      <p>I want to be a part of brining pleasure, grounding, connection, and beauty to the center of trans - specifically trans feminine - bodies.</p>
